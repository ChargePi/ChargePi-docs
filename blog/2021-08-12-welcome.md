Welcome to ChargePi website!

Thank you for checking out the project. The project is still **under development**, but you're welcome to contribute to
it!

The main goal of the project is to create a simple, open source Charging Station for home use. We want the project to be
modular and configurable, so everyone can modify it to their needs!

The support for hardware is limited, but you can change that! Integrate some new hardware to the program.
